### Nginx config example for running this app behind an nginx server
```
location / { 
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_read_timeout 300;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-PORT $remote_port;
} 
```

### Tips
* If you want to run it in a production server, please disable debug mode, set debug as False in settings.
* Try to use Nginx as a front web server (see config example above) and enable SSL, this will prevent your ssh credentials from being uncovered. Also afterwards the communication between your browser and the web server will be encrypted as they use secured websockets.
